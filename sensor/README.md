# inbaverSys - Sensor

A Python based Content Centric Networking (CCN) sensor implementation for sensor networks 
(i.e. the Internet of Things). A sensor nodes implements the functionality of a sensing device
and communicates in using CCN. Every sensor implementa a 3-layer protocol stack which are 
configurable with different protocols. The 3 layers are as follows.

- **Application layer** - implements an application that collects the the sensing data
- **CCN layer** - implements the behaviour of CCN forwarding
- **Link layer** - implements the functionality to communicate with the underlying link technologies
